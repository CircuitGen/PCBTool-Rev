# Development Log - PCBTool-Rev

This log tracks the major development steps taken to refactor the `LLM3_Update.ipynb` notebook into a full-stack web application.

## Session 1: Project Initialization and Backend Scaffolding

1.  **Objective**: Refactor the notebook into a concurrent, full-stack application with a Vue.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.
2.  **Initial Analysis**: Read `mission.md` and `LLM3_Update.ipynb` to understand requirements and existing logic.
3.  **Project Structure**:
    - Created `backend` and `frontend` directories.
    - Scaffolded a complete FastAPI project structure within `backend`.
4.  **Backend Dependencies**: Created `backend/requirements.txt` with all necessary libraries (FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
5.  **Configuration**: Created `backend/app/core/config.py` to store API keys and the updated Dify URL (`http://82.156.209.220/`).
6.  **Database Setup**:
    - Implemented `db/database.py` for the SQLAlchemy engine.
    - Defined `User`, `Conversation`, and `Message` models in `db/models.py` to handle state and user isolation.
7.  **Core Application**:
    - Created `main.py` to initialize the FastAPI app, create database tables, and set up CORS middleware.
    - Created Pydantic schemas in `models/schemas.py` for data validation.
8.  **Initial Endpoint**:
    - Refactored the notebook's "Module 1" (image analysis) into modular services (`dify_service.py`) and database operations (`crud.py`).
    - Implemented the first API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/conversations`.
9.  **Dependency Fix**: Encountered an `ImportError` for `openai`. Updated `requirements.txt` to `openai>=1.0.0` and instructed the user on how to upgrade.

## Session 2: Completing Backend and Frontend Implementation

10. **Backend Feature Completion**:
    - Implemented the remaining notebook modules as distinct services and API endpoints:
      - **Component Analysis**: `component_service.py` and `POST /.../analyze-components`.
      - **Deployment Guide**: `guide_service.py` and `POST /.../generate-deployment-guide`. Added a `/static` route for audio files.
      - **Code Generation**: Updated `dify_service.py` and added `POST /.../generate-code`.
      - **Schematic Generation**: Updated `dify_service.py` and added `POST /.../generate-schematic`.
11. **Input Logic Improvement**:
    - Refactored the `POST /conversations` endpoint and `dify_service` to handle text-only, image-only, or combined inputs, making it more flexible than the original notebook.
12. **Frontend Scaffolding**:
    - Initialized a Vue.js project in the `frontend` directory using `npm`.
    - Installed dependencies: `axios` (for API calls), `pinia` (for state management), and `marked` (for Markdown rendering).
13. **Frontend Structure**:
    - Created a clean structure, including an `api.js` service for backend communication and a `chat.js` Pinia store for state management.
    - Designed a responsive chat interface in `App.vue`.
14. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
    - Connected the frontend to the backend by implementing the `startConversation` action.
    - Created a `MessageRenderer.vue` component to dynamically display different message types (Markdown, tables, code blocks, audio player).
    - Implemented all remaining API calls in `api.js` and corresponding actions in the `chat.js` store.
    - Wired up UI buttons in the `MessageRenderer` to trigger the Pinia actions, completing the interactive workflow.

## Session 3: Documentation

15. **Documentation Creation**:
    - Created a `docs` directory.
    - Wrote a comprehensive `README.md` in the project root, detailing features, tech stack, and setup instructions.
    - Wrote a detailed `DEVELOPMENT.md` in the `docs` directory, documenting the architecture, API endpoints, and frontend state management.
    - Updated both documents to reflect the final, completed state of the initial refactoring.
16. **Log File Creation**: Created this `logs.md` file to persist the development history for future sessions.

**Project Status**: The core refactoring is complete. The application is fully functional, replicating and improving upon the notebook's features in a robust, scalable architecture. All major backend and frontend components are in place and documented.
