# Development Log - PCBTool-Rev

This log tracks the major development steps taken to refactor the `LLM3_Update.ipynb` notebook into a full-stack web application.

## Session 1: Project Initialization and Backend Scaffolding

1.  **Objective**: Refactor the notebook into a concurrent, full-stack application with a Vue.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.
2.  **Initial Analysis**: Read `mission.md` and `LLM3_Update.ipynb` to understand requirements and existing logic.
3.  **Project Structure**:
    - Created `backend` and `frontend` directories.
    - Scaffolded a complete FastAPI project structure within `backend`.
4.  **Backend Dependencies**: Created `backend/requirements.txt` with all necessary libraries (FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
5.  **Configuration**: Created `backend/app/core/config.py` to store API keys and the updated Dify URL (`http://82.156.209.220/`).
6.  **Database Setup**:
    - Implemented `db/database.py` for the SQLAlchemy engine.
    - Defined `User`, `Conversation`, and `Message` models in `db/models.py` to handle state and user isolation.
7.  **Core Application**:
    - Created `main.py` to initialize the FastAPI app, create database tables, and set up CORS middleware.
    - Created Pydantic schemas in `models/schemas.py` for data validation.
8.  **Initial Endpoint**:
    - Refactored the notebook's "Module 1" (image analysis) into modular services (`dify_service.py`) and database operations (`crud.py`).
    - Implemented the first API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/conversations`.
9.  **Dependency Fix**: Encountered an `ImportError` for `openai`. Updated `requirements.txt` to `openai>=1.0.0` and instructed the user on how to upgrade.

## Session 2: Completing Backend and Frontend Implementation

10. **Backend Feature Completion**:
    - Implemented the remaining notebook modules as distinct services and API endpoints.
11. **Input Logic Improvement**:
    - Refactored the `POST /conversations` endpoint to handle text-only, image-only, or combined inputs.
12. **Frontend Scaffolding & Integration**:
    - Initialized a Vue.js project and implemented a full chat interface.
    - Used Pinia for state management and `axios`/`fetch` for API calls.
    - Created a `MessageRenderer.vue` component to dynamically display different message types.
13. **Bug Fixing**:
    - Resolved multiple cascading bugs related to data flow, request formatting (form-data vs. JSON), and response validation (`NameError`, `422 Unprocessable Entity`). The key fixes involved changing requests to use JSON bodies and ensuring Pydantic response models on the backend matched the actual returned data structure.

## Session 3: UI/UX Polish and Finalization

14. **Conversation History**: Implemented `GET /conversations` on the backend and a `fetchHistory` action on the frontend to load previous conversations on startup.
15. **Streaming Responses**:
    - Refactored all backend generation endpoints to use `StreamingResponse`.
    - Updated frontend services to use the `fetch` API to handle `text/event-stream` data.
    - Modified the Pinia store to process streamed events, providing real-time UI updates (e.g., loading spinners, live text generation).
16. **Maintainability**:
    - Added `python-dotenv` to the backend to manage API keys and other configurations via a `.env` file, improving security and ease of use for developers.
    - Created a `.env.example` file as a template.
17. **Conversation Management**:
    - Added a "New Conversation" button to the UI.
    - Implemented the `DELETE /conversations/{id}` endpoint and connected it to a delete button in the UI, allowing users to manage their conversation history.
18. **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` to reflect all new features, including streaming, history, and conversation management.

**Project Status**: The application is functionally complete and stable. All core requirements from the mission have been met and expanded upon with significant UI/UX improvements like streaming and conversation management. The codebase is well-documented and maintainable.
